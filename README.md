# CSCI446_Artificial_Intelligence_Project_1
We will be attempting to graph coloring using the following algorithms: Min-conflicts, Backtracking, Backtracking with Forward Checking, Backtracking with MAC, and genetic algorithms. We will also write a problem generator to test these algorithms.

This program is made using c++ and latex.
