# CSCI446_Artificial_Intelligence_Project_1
We will be attempting to graph coloring using the following algorithms: Min-conflicts, Backtracking, Backtracking with Forward Checking, Backtracking with MAC, and genetic algorithms. We will also write a problem generator to test these algorithms.

This program is made using Python 3.4 and Latex

To run this program, you need to install the dependency 'Tkinter'. On Ubuntu this can be done by 'sudo apt-get install python3-tk'
